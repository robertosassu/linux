IMA Measurements Staging Mechanism
==================================


Introduction
============

The IMA measurements list is currently stored in the kernel memory. Memory
occupation grows linearly with the number of entries, and can become a
problem especially in environments with reduced resources.

While there is an advantage in keeping the IMA measurements list in kernel
memory, so that it is always available for reading from the securityfs
interfaces, storing it elsewhere would make it possible to free precious
memory for other kernel components.

Storing the IMA measurements list outside the kernel does not introduce
security issues, since its integrity is anyway protected by the TPM.

Hence, the new IMA staging mechanism is introduced to allow user space
to remove the desired portion of the measurements list from the kernel.


Usage
=====

The IMA staging mechanism can be enabled from the kernel configuration with
the CONFIG_IMA_STAGING option.

If it is enabled, IMA duplicates the current measurements interfaces (both
binary and ASCII), by adding the ``_staged`` file suffix. Unlike the
existing counterparts, the ``_staged`` interfaces have write permission for
the root user and group, and require the process to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN set.

The staging mechanism supports two flavors.


Staging with prompt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This staging process is achieved with the following steps.

 1. ``echo A > <_staged interface>``: the user requests IMA to stage the
    entire measurements list;
 2. ``cat <_staged interface>``: the user reads the staged measurements;
 3. ``echo D > <_staged interface>`` : the user request IMA to delete
    staged measurements.


Staging and deleting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This staging process is achieved with the following steps.

 1. ``cat <_non_staged interface>``: the user reads the current
    measurements list and determines what the value N for staging should
    be;
 2. ``echo N > <_staged interface>``: the user requests IMA to delete N
    measurements from the current measurements list.


Interface Access
================

In order to avoid the IMA measurements list be suddenly truncated by the
staging mechanism during a read, or having multiple concurrent staging, a
semaphore-like locking scheme has been implemented on all the measurements
list interfaces.

Multiple readers can access concurrently the non-staged interfaces, and
they can be in mutual exclusion with one writer accessing the staged
interfaces.

If an illegal access occurs, the open to the measurements list interface is
denied.


Management of Staged Measurements
=================================

Since with the staging mechanism measurements entries are removed from the
kernel, the user needs to save the staged ones in a storage and concatenate
them together, so that it can present them to remote attestation agents as
if staging was never done.

Coordination is necessary in the case where there are multiple actors
requesting measurements to be staged.

In the staging with prompt case, the staging interface can be accessed only
by one actor at time, so the others will get an error until the former
closes it. Since the actors don't care about N, when they gain access to
the interface, they will get all the staged measurements at the time of
their request.

In the case of staging and deleting, coordination is more important, since
there is the risk that two actors unaware of each other compute the value N
on the current measurements list and request IMA to stage N twice.


Remote Attestation Agent Workflow
=================================

Users can choose the staging method they find more appropriate for their
workflow.

If, as an example, a remote attestation agent would like to present to the
remote attestation server only the measurements that are required to
verify the TPM quote, its workflow would be the following.

With staging with prompt, the agent stages the current measurements list,
reads and stores the measurements in a storage and immediately requests
IMA to delete the staged measurements from kernel memory. Afterwards, it
calculates N by replaying the PCR extend on the stored measurements until
the calculated PCRs match the quoted PCRs. It then keeps the measurements
in excess for the next attestation request.

At the next attestation request, the agent performs the same steps above,
and concatenates the new measurements to the ones in excess from the
previous request. Also in this case, the agent replays the PCR extend until
it matches the currently quoted PCRs, keeps the measurements in excess and
presents the new N measurements entries to the remote attestation server.

With the staging with deleting method, the agents reads the current
measurements list, calculates N and requests IMA to delete only those. The
measurements in excess are kept in the IMA measurements list and can be
retrieved at the next remote attestation request.

Kexec
=====

In the event a kexec() system call occurs between staging and deleting, the
staged measurements entries are prepended to the current measurements lists,
so that they are both available when the secondary kernel starts. In that
case, IMA returns an error to the user when attempting to delete staged
measurements to notify about their copy to the kexec buffer, so that the
user does not store them twice.


Hash table
==========

By default, the template digest of staged measurement entries are kept in
kernel memory (only template data are freed), to be able to detect
duplicate entries independently of staging.

The new kernel option ``ima_flush_htable`` has been introduced to
explicitly request a complete deletion of the staged measurements, for
maximum kernel memory saving. If the option has been specified, duplicate
entries are still avoided on entries of the current measurements list,
but there can be duplicates between different groups of staged
measurements.

Flushing the hash table is supported only for the staging with prompt
flavor. For the staging and deleting flavor, it would have been necessary
to lock the hot path adding new measurements for the time needed to remove
each staged measurement individually.
